-----------HOMEPAGE-----------
The Hostel has one of the best locations in Scotland. From the attractive loch-side garden, the views across to mountain range are breathtaking. Good facilities mean the hostel is popular with walkers and tourist alike.

There are otters, badgers and pine martins in the area. Red deer are numerous, and on the mountains ravens, ptarmigan, golden eagles and mountain hares can be seen on occasion.

We are well situated for walking and exploring some of Scotland's most celebrated scenery"!

With no mobile phone reception the emphasis here is on tranquillity and relaxation!
